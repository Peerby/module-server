/*

This file should be included on the client when you want to load modules from the module server.

`ModuleServer(<module server url>)` returns function `load` which is called with two params:
- path to the module you want to load
- callback, called once it's loaded (with the module as its only argument, no error handling)

When ModuleServer goes to the module server and asks for the module,
it also includes which modules it has requested before.
The module server knows the dependency tree, therefore
it is able to figure out what dependencies are still missing on the client.
It sends the module back together with the missing dependencies.

When the module has loaded, the module is ready to be executed,
and one or more load() callbacks are executed.
(in case the module was requested more than once before it loaded)

There's a bit of magic happening with regards to `ModuleServer.m`:
- after a module is loaded all success callbacks are called with the module's contents:
  `cb(ModuleServer.m[module])`
- however, ModuleServer.m is never set in this file
- therefore, the dependencies that are fetched over the network must register themselves
  on ModuleServer.m
Q: why doesn't `ModuleServer` register the modules in `m`?

/**
 * Creates a Module loader.
 * USAGE:
 *   window.loadModule = ModuleServer('http://url./of/your/module/server/');
 *   loadModule('your/module', function(yourModule) { â€¦ });
 * @param {string} urlPrefix URL prefix of your module server.
 * @param {function(string,Function)=} fetch OPTIONAL function to fetch JS
 *     from a given URL, that fires a callback when the JS fetched. If
 *     you do not provide this function, you need to include $LAB.js in the
 *     current page. If you want to implement your own fetcher, make sure it
 *     supports executing JS in fetch order (ideally without blocking).
 * @param {Function=} getUrl OPTIONAL function to create a URL given the
 *     urlPrefix, the current module name and a list of modules that have
 *     already been requested. You will need to provide this if your server
 *     does not follow the conventions of demo-server.js.
 * @return {function(string, function(*)=)} Returns a function to load modules
 *     The first param is the name of the module and the second param is a
 *     callback that fires when the module loaded. It received the exports
 *     object of the module as its first param.
